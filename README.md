### Purpose

This userscript injects the corresponding [MyDramaList](https://mydramalist.com/699035-tokyo-mer) rating and link into a [TVer series](https://tver.jp/series/srwttibvhk) page, with support from the [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) browser extension. 

It aims for the best possible 1-to-1 matching accuracy despite the limitations described in GH-8.

Using the script allows users to instantly view the rating and directly access the associated MyDramaList page, eliminating the need to navigate away from TVer and searching for it manually via another method.

There are plans to incorporate [Filmarks](https://filmarks.com/dramas/10640/14824) as an additional data source, but the mandatory API endpoints will have to be created from scratch.
